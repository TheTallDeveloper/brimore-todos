So here you are! We need your help with a small Todo App. We already setup a brand new project for you that already contains a very basic Vue.js setup.
Your task is now to finish the Todo App by completing the features to add, edit and delete todos by using [JSONplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Technical starting point
Our team was already able to complete the following:

* Add `Vuex` and create a default store.
* Add [Axios HTTP Client](https://2x.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) for API calls.
* Add [AntDesignVue](https://2x.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) for UI components.

## Mission
- [ ] Fork/Clone this repository into your account.
- [ ] Create a named `vuex` module to hold your todos.
- [ ] Do all your business logic, API Calls, inside the folder named `core`.
- [ ] Complete the CRUD features in the GUI and make sure they are reflected in the `vuex` store.
- [ ] Write concise commit messages.
- [ ] Submit your git repository link to frontend.tech@brimore.com and describe your changes precisely.

## Bonus
- [ ] Add unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and [Vue-Test-Utils](https://next.vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/)
- [ ] Add [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [ ] Document your UI components with [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-docs/introduction).

## Please note
- Pay attention to your code style and structure, don't ignore the eslint hints.
- Design your Vue components: use props, slots and whatever you need to keep your code clean.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, use `AntDesignVue` components when possible.
- Don't pay special attention for responsive design.

## Feel free to
- Improve the design to have better UI and UX.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Use TypeScript.
- Create new modules/methods/components.
- Modify existing code.
- Add new packages.
- Edit `README.md` to add documentation.
